ParentResources
===============

If you has polymorphic models, you already needed of controllers to them. The problem was do this DRY. With this plugin, following idea from Val Aleksenko, you will let your controller more simple to this.


Example
=======

Your controller should be like this:

class CommentsController < ApplicationController
  
  parent_resources :article, :document
  
  def new
    @parent = parent_object
    @comment = Comment.new
  end

  def create

    @parent = parent_object
    @comment = @parent.comments.build(params[:comment])

    if @comment.valid? and @comment.save
      redirect_to send("#{ parent_type }_url", @parent)
    else
      render :action => 'new'
    end

  end
    
end
